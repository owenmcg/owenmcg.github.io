We are a bunch of board game enthusiasts who are looking for any excuse to play board games more often. So we decided to start running an open board games evening, to introduce new players to the marvel of modern board games and give grizzled veterans another excuse to get to the table.

We are currently running our board game evenings in the upstairs bar in Phil Healy's, Wicklow Town every second Tuesday ([check out the date of our next board game night](http://www.wicklowmeeples.com/#welcome)).

Everyone is welcome and we actively encourage new players to come an try out some excellent gateway games. If you have any queries just contact us at wicklowmeeples@gmail.com.

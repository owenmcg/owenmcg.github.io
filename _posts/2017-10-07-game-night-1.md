Tuesday 3rd October saw us kick off our forthnightly board game night.  Many thanks to everyone who popped along.  We had a few initial teething issues, like the venue switching rooms on us just before we got started, but people came by and games got played which are the main things.  We cracked open a bunch of great games.  Here's a quick overview of what was played:

### Santorini
Santorini is a really accessible abstract game which sees players compete to build towers on a 5x5 grid on a floating island.  The components in this game or top notch, it's a floating 3D island! The winner is the first one to see one of their builders climb up to a third level roof.  Simple to learn but with deep strategy, especially when you add in the various hero and god powers which tweak the rules in various ways.  This got played 5 or 6 times in all on opening night, a super game.

### Skull
A perfect bluffing game, up there with Liar's Dice and Poker.  In Skull, also known as 'Skull & Roses', you get a hand of 4 coaster like cards, three of them have a flower depcited and one has a skull.  Players take turns either placing them facedown in front of them or challenging the other players that they can 'flip' a certain number, without revealing a skull.  Of course the next person can raise the bid.  This continues until everyone else passes leaving the last challenger to attempt to make good on their claim.  The only snag is that they have to start by flipping your own facedown stack first... you weren't lying about what was in your own stack were you?  Win two challenges and you win the game, fail a challenge and you lose a card from your hand. An absolute gem! Had great fun playing this on the night, and learnt that Owen is awful at lying!

### NMBR9
The second abstract game played was NMBR9 (no idea how to pronounce that!).  In this you try and place numbered tiles together, forming a 3d stack.  You must touch existing tiles along on edge OR place on top of two already touching tiles without overhanging beyond them.  Tiles on higher levels score more points at the end.  A fiendish little brain burner.

### Century: Spice Road
A beautiful card game where players are caravan leaders who travel the famed silk road to deliver spices to the far reaches of the continent for fame and glory.  The early game is all about building and improving your hand of trading cards that allow you to claim and trade various spices in the form of coloured cubes.  Then, once you have your little economic engine built, the pace ramps up as everyone tries to play their cards to grab said spices so they can complete the contracts.  You are constantly watching what everyone else is doing and trying to undo the plans of others by getting there first.  A gorgeous looking game that is as simple as it is engaging.

### Citadels
I spoke about this one before when I mentioned about [getting hooked on games](http://www.wicklowmeeples.com/getting-hooked-on-games) but I didn't really describe the gameplay.  It's a great role selection game, where you try and build districts in your city but choose a secret character each round to help you achieve your goals.  The character powers are either ones that benefit you in some way, or ones that mess with one of the other characters.  The only issue is that you are targeting other characters, not specific players.  So trying to work out who is choosing which can be quite tricky.  Lots of fun and a game I think I'll have forever in my collection.

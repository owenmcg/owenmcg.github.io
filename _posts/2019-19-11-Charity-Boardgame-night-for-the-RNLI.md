We're all really looking forward to our charity boardgame night in aid of the Wicklow RNLI, starting at 8pm this Friday 22nd Nov 2019 in Wicklow Sailing Club.  Here is a small roundup of just a handful of the great games that will be available to play on the night:


### Just One
Just One is a cooperative party game in which you play together to discover as many mystery words as possible. Players each write the best single word clue they can, to help one of the team members to guess the mystery word. Only unique clues count though, all identical clues are discarded!  A simple game where you need to try and give a useful clue, that isn't so obvious that everyone else will write it down too.  Really fun game that you can learn in about 60 seconds.

### Survive: Escape from Atlantis
Survive is a cutthroat game where players seek to evacuate their ten little meeples from an island that is rapidly sinking.  They need to remember which pieces are their highest-valued ones as they try and move towards the safety of the surrounding islands. Players can either swim or use boats to travel but must avoid sea serpents, whales and sharks on their way to safety.  A classic boardgame with a competitive edge to it.

### Santorini
Santorini is a really accessible abstract game which sees two players compete to build towers on a 5x5 grid.  The winner is the first one to see one of their builders climb up to a third level roof.  You move, you build.. that's it.  Simple to learn but with deep strategy, especially when you add in the various hero and god powers.  The components are top notch and it looks amazing on the table.  Superb 2 player game.

### Skull
A pure bluffing game, up there with Liar's Dice and Poker.  In Skull, you get a hand of 4 coaster-like cards, three of them have a flower depcited and one has a skull.  Each turn you either place a card facedown into a stack in front of you, or challenge that you can reveal X number of cards from around the table, without revealing a skull.  The only snag is that they have to start by flipping your own facedown stack first... You weren't lying about what was in your own stack were you?  Win two challenges and you win the game. An absolute gem!

### Ticket to Ride: Europe
Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a train adventure across early 20th century Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople, players strive to build the most powerful train empire by building routes across the continent. A beautifully simple game that sees 2-5 players jostle for position across a delightful map of everyone's favourite continent.

### Century: Spice Road
A beautiful card game where players travel the silk road to deliver spices to the far reaches of the continent for fame and glory.  The early game is all about building and improving your hand of trading cards and then the pace ramps up as everyone vies to complete the best contracts.  You are constantly interested in what everyone else is doing and the turns come thick and fast.  A really engaging game.

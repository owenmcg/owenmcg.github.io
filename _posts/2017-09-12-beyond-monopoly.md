Most of us have sat around a table at some point in our lives and become power-mad property magnates in Monopoly or thrown all of our eggs into the 'Colonel Mustard in the Drawing Room with the lead pipe' basket. Copies of Monopoly and Cluedo sit dusty and incomplete on a long forgotten shelf in most houses. Board games are just a fond memory, something you played as a kid.

What if I told you that board games have since moved beyond Monopoly. That they have become nuanced, engaging, social, tactical, treacherous, ridiculous and just down right fun. There has been a steady board game renaissance building over the last 20 years and it has gained huge momentum in the last 10-12 in particular.

### What are these games?

I'm glad you asked. They are games like Pandemic, where you collaborate with your fellow players to stop a deadly virus (or four) from consuming the human race! Or Flamme Rouge, where you compete as a team of cyclists (Tour de France style) to see who can put their sprinter in the best position to burst home and take first place. Or The Resistance where one of you is a traitor, trying to secretly sabotage every mission without being caught by the other players. There is a whole world of board games out there that you have likely never heard of (I know I hadn't).

### Where can I play these games?

Another excellent question. We will have all of the above mentioned games and many, many more at the [Wicklow Meeples board game evenings](https://www.facebook.com/wicklowmeeples) in Phil Healy's pub every second Tuesday (starting on the 3rd of October). There will be four of us Meeples there on the night to help get you set up and ready to game for the night.

So if this sounds up your street why not let us know you'll be coming. Just visit our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wicklowmeeples) or our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Board-Game-Evening-Wicklow-Meeples/). Also, if you have any questions just email us at [wicklowmeeples@gmail.com](mailto:wicklowmeeples@gmail.com) or message us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wicklowmeeples)/[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Board-Game-Evening-Wicklow-Meeples/).

Thanks for reading and hope to see you there.

Oh, and keep an eye out for the extended 'Beyond Monopoly' series of posts, where we will run through some of the games on offer on the night in more detail.

Beware the 29th of October, 2019! For on this night the air will be thick with screams of agony and maniacal laughter. Why, I hear you ask...for on this night, the eve of the eve of All Hallows Eve only the spookiest and most sinister of board games will make it to the table in the annual Wicklow Meeples:

Horrifying board games? Could it be so? Why yes it could. If you dare to venture to our eery evening you could end up becoming a ne'er do well innkeeper looking to make a morbid profit off their ill-fated guests, or a simple villager desperate to find out who amongst their trusted companions is indeed a werewolf...before the full moon rises once more!

Below you will find games of the like you have never witnessed before. Come along on the 29th and give them a whirl...if you dare!

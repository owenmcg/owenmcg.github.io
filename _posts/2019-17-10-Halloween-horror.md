Beware the 29th of October, 2019! For on this night the air will be thick with screams of agony and maniacal laughter. Why, I hear you ask...for on this night, the eve of the eve of All Hallows Eve only the spookiest and most sinister of board games will make it to the table in the annual Wicklow Meeples:

Horrifying board games? Could it be so? Why yes it could. If you dare to venture to our eery evening you could end up becoming a ne'er do well innkeeper looking to make a morbid profit off their ill-fated guests, or a simple villager desperate to find out who amongst their trusted companions is indeed a werewolf...before the full moon rises once more!

Below you will find games of the like you have never witnessed before. Come along on the 29th and give them a whirl...if you dare!

### The Bloody Inn

France 1831: In a remote corner of Ard√®che, the little village of Peyrebeille sees numerous travelers pass through. A family of greedy rural farmers is determined to make its fortune and has devised a diabolical stratagem to achieve this goal: Invest in an inn so they can rob traveling guests, getting rich without arousing the suspicions of the police! Whether or not their plan will work out, one thing is certain: Not every guest will leave this inn alive.

### Mysterium

It's the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, detects a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland and  gathers a group of eminent mediums to attempt to make contact with the ghost. They have seven hours to make contact and unlock this old murder mystery.

In Mysterium all of the players take on the role of mediums, bar one. This last player is the ghost and their only means of communication with the mediums is through strange psychic dreams and by knocking on the table. All of the players (including the ghost) are working together to try and solve this age old murder and set the spirit to rest.

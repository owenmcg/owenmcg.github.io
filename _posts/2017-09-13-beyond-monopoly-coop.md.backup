This is the second post in our 'Beyond Monopoly' series and we are going to focus on co-operative (co-op) games in this post. Co-op games see the players work together as a team to overcome a common goal. The only villain in a co-op game is the game itself. Some of my favourite games are co-ops; there is a palpable joy in overcoming the seemingly insurmountable task in front of you! In this post I will be listing a number of games that will be available [to play at our board game evenings](http://www.wicklowmeeples.com/#welcome).

### Pandemic
Pandemic sets the players up as an elite disease control team battling to keep 4 deadly diseases at bay. Working against the clock you must travel the globe searching for a cure amid outbreaks and epidemics. Varied roles see players having to work together to ensure the future of the human race.

### Mysterium
Mysterium is a co-op with a twist. One of you is speaking from beyond the grave. Mysterium takes place in a haunted mansion in the 1920s and sees a team of up to 6 psychics attempt to communicate with the poor soul who met an unfortunate end. You have but one night to determine whodunnit through the dreamlike visions the ghost will impart upon you.

### Forbidden Island
In Forbidden Island a team of 2-4 players take on the roles of intrepid explorers. You must rescue ancient artefacts hidden around the island before it plunges into the sea, never to be seen again. Each player has a different role and must work together to ensure they all escape the island alive.

That's a very quick run through of some of the co-op games that we will be running at our board game evenings. Keep an eye out for the next post in this series that will focus on Party games.

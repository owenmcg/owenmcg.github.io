It is with great pleasure that I announce that the very first Wicklow Meeples Board Games Club open board gaming night will take place on the 3rd of October. We are delighted to be hosting our board gaming nights in the Bridge Tavern, Wicklow Town.

We will be situated upstairs in the newly refurbished function room from 7.30pm until 11pm. There will be a €5 pay to play charge for each player. If you think you can make it just let us know on our Meetup page or our Facebook page. And feel free to share this with any family and/or friends who you think would be interested.

To quickly recap:

- The Bridge Tavern
- Tuesday, 3rd of October

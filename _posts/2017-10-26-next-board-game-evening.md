We are running our next Board Game Evening on the 7th of November in the wonderful surroundings of The Bridge Tavern on Bridge Street in Wicklow Town.

We will be situated in the newly refurbished function room upstairs from 7.30pm until 11pm. We'll bring the games, so you just bring yourself.  There's a small charge of €5, not bad for an entire night's gaming!  This covers the venue cost, replacing damaged/lost components and any remainder goes into new games for the club.  If you think you can make it just let us know on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Board-Game-Evening-Wicklow-Meeples/) or our [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/wicklowmeeples). And feel free to share this with any family and/or friends who you think would be interested.

To quickly recap:

- The Bridge Tavern, Bridge Street, Wicklow Town.
- Tuesday, 7th of November
- 7.30pm - 11pm
- Only €5 to play

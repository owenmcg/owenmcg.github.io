Ermagerd!! Pardy, pardy, pardyyyy! Got more than 4 people? Don't sweat it, party games have got you covered. Party games aim to lean on skills that we all have to lesser or greater degrees. They are a great leveller and after setting up a party game hilarity generally ensues. Below are a number of party games that will be available [to play at our board game evenings](https://www.facebook.com/wicklowmeeples).

### Cockroach Salad
Cockroach Salad has five card types; lettuce, tomato, cauliflower, pepper and cockroach. It is this simplicity that makes the game so infuriatingly funny. Simply place your top card on top of the salad pile and say what you see. However, there are a couple of evil twists that will have you, and up to 5 other players, completely tongue tied and generally in stitches.

### One Night Ultimate Werewolf
Despite its preposterous name One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a timeless classic. Up to 10 people take on the role of murderously paranoid villagers who know that 1 or even 2 of their number are werewolves. But who could it be? You have 10 minutes to decide who gets the chop!

### Cockroach Poker
The older sibling of Cockroach Salad, Cockroach Poker is a game of pure bluffing delight. The similarities to poker end with the fact that you have a hand of cards. The object of the game is to fool your opponents into collecting four-of-a-kind of any one card. You will never trust anyone ever again.

### Exploding Kittens
Best described as kitten-powered Russian roulette. The aim for each of the 2-5 players is to avoid getting blown to smithereens by, you guessed it, an 'Exploding Kitten!'. With other, more benign, cats like Beard Cat and Cattermelon, Exploding Kittens is a light-hearted card game with just the right amount of tension.

This is the third post in our 'Beyond Monopoly' series and we are going to focus on gateway games in this post. Gateway games offer a seamless transition from traditional boardgames (like Monopoly) into the world of modern boardgames. They often have similarities to traditional games we are familiar with, but with a subtle twist. In this post I will be listing a number of games that will be available [to play at our board game evenings](https://www.facebook.com/wicklowmeeples).

### Ticket to Ride: Europe
Ticket to Ride: Europe takes you on a train adventure across early 20th century Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople, players strive to build the most powerful train empire by building routes across the continent. A beautifully simple game that sees 2-5 players jostle for position across a delightful map of everyone's favourite continent.

### Kingdomino
Kingdomino sees 2-4 players take on the role of rival lords seeking to expand their kingdoms in a genius twist on the age old game of dominos. Watch your tiny little kingdom expand as you match tiles by terrain type and strive to create the finest kingdom on the table. Inidentally, it won the coveted [Spiel des Jahres 2017](http://www.spiel-des-jahres.com/en/kingdomino).

### Flamme Rouge
Flamme Rouge is a tactical, fast paced bicycle racing game which pits 2-4 teams against one another. Using a combination of two riders (sprinter & rouleur) players look to slipstream and take advantage of the mountain sections to get one of their riders across the finish line in first place.

### King of Tokyo
RRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In King of Tokyo players take the role of a city wrecking monster of Godzilla proportions. Building up your power reserves by rolling the (particularly nice) dice, your aim is to rampage over your opponents with total impunity!
